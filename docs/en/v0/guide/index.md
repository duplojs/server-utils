# Introduction

The `@duplojs/server-utils` library is part of the DuploJS ecosystem. It provides a set of reusable technical utilities to handle common server-side needs. The goal is to offer simple, typed, and consistent helpers to limit duplication and make project maintenance easier.

## Role

`@duplojs/server-utils` serves as a cross-cutting toolbox in the DuploJS ecosystem:

- centralize reliable system operations (read/write, permissions, temporary files);
- expose consistent APIs regardless of the runtime environment;
- provide types and interfaces to better structure application code.
