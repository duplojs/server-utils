Set the execution environment for server-utils.

This is usually not required because the environment is detected automatically.
Use it to force a specific runtime (NODE, DENO, or BUN) when needed.

If a runtime-specific implementation is missing, the NODE version is used as
the fallback because it exists for all functions.
